# REDOX

## About

Redox is a markup language similar to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) for Emacs.

## Usecases

Redox is designed mainly for the [Oxide](https://github.com/AnodeDev/oxide) text editor, as it's one of the methods of configuring it (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!), but it can be used to just format text just like Markdown and Org Mode. I made it mainly because I really liked looking at my Emacs configuration since it looked so clean and organized, and I really wanted to implement something similar in my own text editor.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Design the syntax
- [ ] Implement the syntax
- [ ] Write a lexer to easily use the files in other projects
- [ ] Done :)
